When the Rosies heard I was doing a presentation on rationing, they told me I had to make “Dump Cake”.  Dump Cake was popular during the war because it required no butter, eggs or milk and only a single cup of sugar.  And – this is the fun part – you mix it in the pan that it’s baked in.  Give it a try.

Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups of flour
- 1 cup of sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 2 tablespoons of cocoa
- 1 tablespoon of white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 5 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 cup cold water (not iced)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine dry ingredients in a flour sifter and sift into an ungreased 8×8 square or a 9-inch round baking pan. You can also use a 9-inch cast-iron skillet.

Poke three holes into the flour mixture. In the first hole, pour the vinegar. In the second hole, pour the vanilla. In the third hole, pour the oil.  Then pour one cup of water into the pan and mix very well.

Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes or less, until done. Cut in squares and sprinkle top with powdered sugar.  It’s good and it’s Vegan!

Ranger Raphael Allen,  at Rosie the Riveter/ WWII Home Front National Park, shared this gingerbread recipe with me.  Another WWII favorite – I’m going to try it this weekend.
