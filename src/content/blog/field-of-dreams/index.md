That's what came to mind when I first arrived at Vintage Campers in Peru, Indiana. I'd foolishly worried about not being able to find the place. Proprietor Dan Piper explained that he'd "got the disease -- bad" and started collecting.

Vintage Campers is located on what used to be a "poor farm". Dan bought the property from the State of Indiana and started an architectural salvage company that gradually gave way to the camper business.

With my Beemer hitched to my Ranger, I started the 2400 mile trek home.

You will ask if I factored fuel costs into the price of the trailer. I did, but not enough. Still, I'm happy with the Beemer. She's gonna come back nicely.
