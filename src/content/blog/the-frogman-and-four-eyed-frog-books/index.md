I was driving through Gualala, California when I saw an adopt a highway sign: the litter free road was compliments of Four-Eyed Frog Books.

The store is situated on Ocean Drive and is a labor of love for Frogman Joel Crockett, who operates it as a kind of community center. When I told him I'd just published a novel, he asked if I'd like to be a guest on his Friday Fun radio show.

As promised, the show was FUN. And the reading I did on Saturday afternoon was also enjoyable.

Four-Eyed Frog special orders books and offers on-line fulfillment. Their website is www.foureyedfrog.com We need to support local businesses like Joel's because they offer so much more than a place to buy things -- they offer a place to gather, to interact with knowledgable booksellers, and in the case of Four-Eyed Frog, pick up litter along the highway!
