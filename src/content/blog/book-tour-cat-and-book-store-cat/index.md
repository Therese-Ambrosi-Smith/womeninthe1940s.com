Loofie (aka Alice Aloof) has been my faithful traveling companion on the Tin Can Camper Book Tour. For the most part, our journey's been uneventful. We did a little off-roading on the back side of Mount Rainer (inadvertently -- the GPS route was ridiculous) and Loofie protested by hiding out all night, but I rewarded her the next night by taking her to a Motel 6.

There's something about cats and books. The most famous bookstore cat I've met recently is Henry, the most beloved member of the Orca Books pod in Olympia Washington. Orca Books staff adopted Henry from a rescue organization called Feline Friends. Legend has it that Henry was found in a burned out barn, bringing food to starving kittens.
