I was happy to have the booth next to Kaiser Heritage during last weekend's Home Front Festival in Richmond. The health care network that now serves 8.6 million members was born in the Richmond shipyards during WWII.

Wax was featured in the Heritage blog last week: http://www.kaiserpermanentehistory.org/tag/therese-ambrosi-smith/

Thank you so much!

If you visit Richmond, you can see the old Kaiser Field Hospital. It's not open to the public now, but as plans for Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historic Park come to fruition, there ae fantastic opportunities for interpretation.
