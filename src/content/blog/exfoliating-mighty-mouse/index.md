It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I discovered rubbing compound. Who knew that fifty-seven years of oxidation would buff off? I bought one of every compound they carried at Napa Auto Supply and went to work. The stuff that exfoliated
best was for polishing mag wheels.

The camper needs a name. Mighty Mouse was suggested. Mighty Mouse might be about the right vintage.
