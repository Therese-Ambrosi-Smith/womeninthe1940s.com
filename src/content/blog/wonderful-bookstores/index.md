I'm grateful to the independent booksellers hosting me in their wonderful stores -- I've just updated the schedule. I'll be starting in the north in mid-September; the grand circle of Washington state runs from Walla Walla, to Spokane, to Leavenworth (and a bookstore with a tree house), to Bellingham, Bainbridge Island and Olympia. The store in Olympia has a resident cat and orca pod. I can't wait. Of course this has taken lots of planning...
