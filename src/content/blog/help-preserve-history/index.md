For all that’s been written about The War, The Greatest Generation’s gay and lesbian life is not well chronicled – particularly on the home front. The National Park Service is actively seeking individuals to contribute their unique stories to the diverse history interpreted at Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park — in Richmond, California — just 18 miles north and east of San Francisco.

In addition, funds are being raised for a traveling exhibit that will tell the GLBT story. The exhibit will open in Richmond, then be made available to other WWII historic sites on request.

“Wax” tells the story of a young lesbian who struggles to conform to post-war expectations of marriage and family; the Trust has sold the book in the Visitor Center store since it opened and  I’m grateful for their support. Now it’s time to give back. All proceeds from the sale of “Wax” through Edwards Brothers Malloy, will be donated to the Rosie The Riveter Trust to support exhibit development. The “Buy Print Book” link in the side menu bar will take you to the Edwards Brothers Malloy shopping cart.

An estimated 650,000 gays served in the Armed Forces during WWII, despite the official ban on their participation.  The war offered an opportunity for women to serve in non-combat roles, where many lesbians found sisterhood – sometimes for the first time. Anyone with stories to share is encouraged to contact Park Ranger Elizabeth Tucker at 510-232-3108, before this history is lost.
