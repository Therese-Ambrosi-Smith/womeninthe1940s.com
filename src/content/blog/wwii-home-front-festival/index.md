On October 15th I had the pleasure of participating in the Richmond, WWII Home Front Festival, a cooperative effort between the City of Richmond, the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, and the National Park Service. I hadn't attended before, but I will attend again. The music alone, was worth the drive: gospel, blues, swing, jazz -- and the event was free. Contra Costa Culinary Academy cooked up some snacks, the Richmond Rotary hosted an antique car show and there was a Friday night USO dance. Mark your calendar for next year.
